feat(core): [Prompt] Optimized Prompt Engineering and Templates

Story of Collaboration:
We found that Flux.2 prompts are highly sensitive to word order. The user asked for better consistency, so we rebuilt the prompt generation logic to ensure the "Asset Type + Subject" always occupies the first 5 words (the highest weight zone).

Decisions Made:
- Refactored `prompt-builder.ts` to follow a strict priority-ordered structure: Subject -> Pose -> Style -> Lighting -> Perspective.
- Expanded `prompt-templates.ts` to include specialized markers for Icons, UI Elements, and Tileable Terrain.
- Implemented "Consistency Markers" that automatically inject style anchor context into every generated asset prompt.
- Added support for Character Registry seeds to ensure pose-to-pose consistency.

Challenges:
- Balancing descriptive detail with the word-weight limits required several iterations of "clean room" testing against the templates.

Tests Added:
- Unit tests for all 6 core asset-type templates.
- Regression tests for the priority-weighted prompt builder logic.
