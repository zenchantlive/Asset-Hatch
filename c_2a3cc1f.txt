feat(core): [System] Model Registry and Cost Tracking System

Story of Collaboration:
As we scaled the generation phase, we realized tracking costs across different providers and models was becoming complex. We paired to build a centralized registry that not only tracks costs but also allows for dynamic route switching between dev and pro models.

Decisions Made:
- Implemented a `ModelRegistry` to store metadata, capabilities, and pricing for all AI models (OpenRouter based).
- Created a `CostTracker` utility to handle token calculations and localized pricing.
- Added a persistence layer via Dexie and Prisma to sync actual costs from API responses.
- Documented the architecture in `ADR-018: Model Registry and Cost Tracking`.
- Implemented an API endpoint `/api/generation/sync-cost` to heartbeat actual costs to the server.

Challenges:
- Synchronizing cost data between the client (immediate feedback) and server (source of truth) required a custom sync flow to handle race conditions during batch generations.
- Local storage of cost data needed to be lightweight to avoid bloat in IndexedDb.

Tests Added:
- Unit tests for ModelRegistry and CostTracker logic.
- Integration tests for the full cost-sync flow from API to database.
