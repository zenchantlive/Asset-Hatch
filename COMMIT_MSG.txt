fix(routing): Fix project creation flow redirects and lint errors

Story of Collaboration:
User reported that clicking 'Assets First' or 'Game First' in the New Project 
dialog was redirecting to a stub page instead of the actual planning interface.
Through systematic debugging using the roster.md personas (Red Team, Practical
Implementer, Unintended Consequences), we identified multiple cascading issues:

1. UnifiedProjectCard was linking to /project/[id] (stub) instead of /project/[id]/planning
2. The /project/[id]/page.tsx was a stub with 'Assets Tab' placeholder
3. router.refresh() after router.push() may have caused race conditions
4. A Turbopack bundler crash was masking the actual navigation success

Decisions Made:
- Converted /project/[id]/page.tsx from stub to a simple redirect to /project/[id]/planning
- Updated UnifiedProjectCard to link directly to the planning page
- Removed router.refresh() after router.push() to prevent race conditions
- Added debug console logging to layout.tsx and NewProjectDialog.tsx
- Fixed hydration mismatch by adding suppressHydrationWarning to relative time

Challenges:
- Turbopack bundler crash (Failed to write app endpoint) obscured the real issue
- Had to trace logs to confirm 200 OK responses before crash
- Required prisma generate after cache clear to restore @prisma/client
