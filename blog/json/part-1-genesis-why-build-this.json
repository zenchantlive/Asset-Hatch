The agents could scaffold systems, wire up logic, and get a playable prototype on screen in hours. The real friction wasn’t that AI art was impossible—it was that there was no scaffolding or workflow to make generating a full set of usable assets *easy*.\n\n### The Pattern\n\nHere's what would happen almost every time:\n\n```plaintext\nMe: \"Let's add some character sprites for the player.\"  \nClaude: \"I can help you set up the sprite system. You'll need to:  \n  1. Create placeholder rectangles for now  \n  2. Find sprites from itch.io or OpenGameArt  \n  3.

Momentum gone. The project stalled because the “last mile” between idea and shippable assets was still manual.\n\n## Where Asset Hatch was … hatched\n\nAI coding agents are phenomenal at generating code, refactoring systems, writing tests, and debugging edge cases. But when it came to assets, there was no opinionated pipeline: no place where you could describe a game, get a structured asset plan, and then walk out with a full pack ready to drop into a project.\n\nWhat was missing wasn’t just better images; it was:\n\n* A way to enumerate everything the game would need\n    \n* A single flow that took you from “idea” to “assets + manifests”\n    \n* A tool built around game concepts like sprite sheets, tilesets, and animation sets\n    \n\nThis realization lead me down the 11 day, dusk till dawn, expedition which lead to the writing of this blog.\n\n### The Deeper Issue\n\nGame assets aren't just individual images. They're a **system**. A character isn't one sprite; it's:\n\n* Idle animation (4 frames)\n    \n* Walk cycle (8 frames)\n    \n* Attack animation (6 frames)\n    \n* Multiple directions (north, south, east, west)\n    \n* Consistent proportions across all of them\n    \n* Matching color palette\n    \n* Same art style throughout\n    \n\nWhen you ask an AI coding agent to generate these, it treats each request independently.
