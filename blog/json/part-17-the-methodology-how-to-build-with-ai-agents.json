The Memory Files\n\nWe maintained four \"Living Documents\" in the root of the repo. These were read by the AI at the start of every session:\n\n* `active_state.md`: The current brain dump. What are we working on *right now*? What just broke?\n    \n* `system_patterns.md`: The \"Physics\" of our world. \"We always use discriminators for state unions.\" \"We never leave `any` types.\"\n    \n* `project_roadmap.md`: The high-level map.\n    \n* **ADRs**: The \"Why.\"\n    \n\n### 2\\.
