The penultimate day of the year. While most people were thinking about champagne and resolutions, I was thinking about how to stop my AI from being \"too helpful\" and how to make it see.\n\nWelcome to Part 11. It’s about the checks, the balances, and why singularization is harder than it looks.\n\n## Style Anchors: Teaching the AI to See\n\nThe biggest challenge today was \"Style Consistency.\" You can't just tell an AI \"make it look like my other assets\" and expect it to work. You have to feed it the actual DNA of your style.\n\nWe collaborated on the **Style Anchor system** ([ADR-008](https://github.com/zenchantlive/Asset-Hatch/blob/main/src/memory/adr/008-style-anchor-image-generation.md)).\n\n* We use **GPT-4o vision** to analyze user-uploaded reference images.\n    \n* It extracts specific keywords for lighting, colors, and brushwork.\n    \n* We even built a canvas-based color palette extractor.\n    \n\nNow, instead of a vague description, every prompt is injected with a \"Style Anchor\" payload that forces visual consistency.\n\n## The Safety Net: One Cat, Please\n\nThen there was the \"Singularization Crisis.\"\n\nOur AI has a tendency toward maximalism. You ask it for a \"cat sprite,\" and it thinks, \"You know what would be better? A cat, in a hat, on a mat, with a bat, in a 13-stage isometric animation sequence.\"\n\nNo. I just want the cat.\n\nWe implemented **The Safety Net** ([ADR-008](https://github.com/zenchantlive/Asset-Hatch/blob/main/src/memory/adr/008-style-anchor-image-generation.md)). We pulled in the `pluralize` library and wired it into the `prompt-builder.ts`. Now, the system looks at the AI's flowery descriptions and ruthlessly singularizes the subject.\n\n**AI:** \"A group of cheerful farmers tending to their crops in a sunny field.\" **The Safety Net:** \"A cheerful farmer.\"\n\nIt's the digital equivalent of a \"Shut up and sit down\" for AI creativity.\n\n## Hardening the Hatch\n\nWith the open-source release looming, we spent the afternoon in a \"Security Hardening\" rabbit hole.\n\n* **Zod Guardians**: Every API route now has a Zod schema at the gate.
