  "contentMarkdown": "**The Date:** January 4, 2026 **The Goal:** Moving from \"functional\" to \"frictionless.\" **The Result:** A production-ready generation pipeline that enforces consistency.\n\nEvery project hits a point where the core features are \"done,\" but the experience feels... crunchy. In the last 48 hours, we went through a final technical debt purge and a significant workflow refactor to make Asset Hatch feel like a professional tool.\n\n## The Consistency Enforcement: Front-First Workflow\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in AI asset generation is visual consistency across different directions. Even with style anchors, Flux.2 can sometimes drift.\n\nWe realized that for a \"moveable\" asset (like a hero or an NPC), the **Front View** is the source of truth. If the front view isn't right, there's no point in generating the left, right, or back views.\n\n### The Refactor: `DirectionGrid` v3.1\n\n![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1767572650284/4ec96f1b-bf4b-400c-b0f7-b39ac9105df1.png align=\"center\")\n\nWe rebuilt the `DirectionGrid` to enforce a strict **Front-First** logic:\n\n1. All other direction cells are disabled until a Front view is generated and **approved**.\n    \n2. Once the Front view is approved, its image blob is used as a `referenceImage` for all subsequent directional generations.\n    \n3. This ensures that the character's colors, silhouette, and style are locked in before the AI tries to guess what their back looks like.\n    \n\nWe also cleaned up the grid UI. The \"Approve/Reject\" buttons were cluttering the 3x3 grid, making it hard to see the tiny details. We moved all controls to a persistent **Active Direction Info** panel below the grid. The grid cells now only show a subtle hover state and a \"Maximize\" icon.\n\n## The Unified Action Bar\n\nAs the generation page grew, we had buttons everywhere: \"Regenerate Batch,\" \"Accept All,\" \"Export ZIP,\" \"Back to Planning.\" It was cognitive overload.\n\nWe implemented a **Unified Action Bar** at the bottom of the screen. It's a context-aware command center that changes based on your current state:\n\n* **Planning Mode:** Shows \"Finalize Plan.\"\n    \n* **Generation Mode:** Shows \"Generate Remaining\" and \"Accept All.\"\n    \n* **Selection Mode:** Shows \"Compare\" and \"Batch Approve.\"\n    \n\nBy centralizing the primary actions, we cleared up the header and gave the app a much more \"pro\" feel.\n\n## Mobile Excellence: Beyond the Layout\n\nIn Part 15, we built the slide-out overlays. In *this* phase, we optimized the content *inside* those overlays for touch.\n\n### 1\\. The Flat Asset List\n\nOn mobile, the hierarchical \"Category &gt; Asset\" view was too many taps. We replaced it with a **FlatAssetList**—a high-density, searchable scroll view that lets you jump between assets instantly.\n\n### 2\\. Modal Model Selection\n\nInstead of a dropdown or an inline panel (which ate up screen real estate), we moved the model selector (Flux.2 vs Gemini 3 Pro) to a beautiful, touch-friendly **Bottom Modal**.
