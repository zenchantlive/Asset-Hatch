## Memory System (ALWAYS DO THIS)
**Before working**: Read `memory/active_state.md`, `memory/PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `memory/system_patterns.md`
**Before committing**: Update `active_state.md`, add patterns to `system_patterns.md`, create ADR for big decisions

## Commands
```bash
bun dev              # Dev server
bun build && bun start # Production
bun run lint         # ESLint
bun run typecheck    # Type check
bun run test         # Jest watch
bunx prisma studio   # DB GUI
```

## Tech Stack (One-liner)
Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript strict | Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui | Vercel AI SDK v6 + OpenRouter (Gemini) | Prisma (SQLite) + Dexie (IndexedDB cache)

## Architecture Summary
- **4 Phases**: Planning → Style Anchor → Generation → Export
- **Dual DB**: Prisma = server truth, Dexie = client cache. API routes use Prisma, components use Dexie.
- **AI Tools**: Chat calls `streamText()` with tools → tool executes → streams back via SSE

## Critical Gotchas
1. **WSL2 Split**: User runs `bun` in Windows PowerShell, Claude operates in WSL2 - user runs commands manually
2. **AI SDK v6 Tool Detection**: Use `useRef` for `processedIds` Set to prevent infinite loops
3. **Token Limits**: Never return base64 in tool results - return ID, fetch image separately
4. **Prisma ↔ Client**: Map `art_style` → `artStyle` between layers

## Code Rules
- `"use client"` only when hooks are needed
- No `any` or `unknown` types
- Add line-by-line comments explaining reasoning
- Reuse existing code, keep files short and focused
- Use `cn()` for conditional Tailwind classes

## Git Commits (Blog Notebook Strategy)
Format: `type(scope): Title`

Body must include:
- **Story of Collaboration**: What did user ask? How did we iterate?
- **Decisions Made**: Why this architecture?
- **Challenges**: What was hard?

This feeds our "Building in Public" blog - be honest, vulnerable, and technically detailed.

## Blog Voice
Humorous, narrative-driven, technically honest. Admit mistakes. Highlight "loops" (recursive errors, ironic moments). Not corporate marketing - developer diary.

## MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations, with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs.
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Same repository
   - Register an identity: call `ensure_project`, then `register_agent` using this repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before you edit: `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)` to signal intent and avoid conflict.
   - Communicate with threads: use `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`; check inbox with `fetch_inbox` and acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`.
   - Read fast: `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20` or `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Tip: set `AGENT_NAME` in your environment so the pre-commit guard can block commits that conflict with others' active exclusive file reservations.

2) Across different repos in one project (e.g., Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
   - Option A (single project bus): register both sides under the same `project_key` (shared key/path). Keep reservation patterns specific (e.g., `frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
   - Option B (separate projects): each repo has its own `project_key`; use `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact`/`respond_contact` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) across repos for clean summaries/audits.

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros when you want speed or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need control: `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`.

Common pitfalls
- "from_agent not registered": always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use a non-exclusive reservation when appropriate.
- Auth errors: if JWT+JWKS is enabled, include a bearer token with a `kid` that matches server JWKS; static bearer is used only when JWT is disabled.

## Integrating with Beads (dependency-aware task planning)

Beads provides a lightweight, dependency-aware issue database and a CLI (`bd`) for selecting "ready work," setting priorities, and tracking status. It complements MCP Agent Mail's messaging, audit trail, and file-reservation signals. Project: [steveyegge/beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads)

Recommended conventions
- **Single source of truth**: Use **Beads** for task status/priority/dependencies; use **Agent Mail** for conversation, decisions, and attachments (audit).
- **Shared identifiers**: Use the Beads issue id (e.g., `bd-123`) as the Mail `thread_id` and prefix message subjects with `[bd-123]`.
- **Reservations**: When starting a `bd-###` task, call `file_reservation_paths(...)` for the affected paths; include the issue id in the `reason` and release on completion.

Typical flow (agents)
1) **Pick ready work** (Beads)
   - `bd ready --json` → choose one item (highest priority, no blockers)
2) **Reserve edit surface** (Mail)
   - `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true, reason="bd-123")`
3) **Announce start** (Mail)
   - `send_message(..., thread_id="bd-123", subject="[bd-123] Start: <short title>", ack_required=true)`
4) **Work and update**
   - Reply in-thread with progress and attach artifacts/images; keep the discussion in one thread per issue id
5) **Complete and release**
   - `bd close bd-123 --reason "Completed"` (Beads is status authority)
   - `release_file_reservations(project_key, agent_name, paths=["src/**"])`
   - Final Mail reply: `[bd-123] Completed` with summary and links

Mapping cheat-sheet
- **Mail `thread_id`** ↔ `bd-###`
- **Mail subject**: `[bd-###] …`
- **File reservation `reason`**: `bd-###`
- **Commit messages (optional)**: include `bd-###` for traceability

Event mirroring (optional automation)
- On `bd update --status blocked`, send a high-importance Mail message in thread `bd-###` describing the blocker.
- On Mail "ACK overdue" for a critical decision, add a Beads label (e.g., `needs-ack`) or bump priority to surface it in `bd ready`.

Pitfalls to avoid
- Don't create or manage tasks in Mail; treat Beads as the single task queue.
- Always include `bd-###` in message `thread_id` to avoid ID drift across tools.
