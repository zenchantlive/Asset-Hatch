# Project Brief

Asset Hatch is a Next.js web application focused on asset generation and management.
It leverages AI capabilities (OpenAI SDK) and client-side processing (ColorThief, JSZip).
Data is likely persisted locally using Dexie.js (IndexedDB wrapper).
The project includes a UI system based on Radix UI and potentially shadcn/ui.
